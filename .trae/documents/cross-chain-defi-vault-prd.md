# Cross-Chain DeFi Vault - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview
A Cross-Chain DeFi Vault that functions as a "super savings account" allowing users to deposit tokens on any supported blockchain and automatically invest across multiple chains for optimal yield generation.

The vault solves the problem of fragmented DeFi yields across different blockchains by providing a unified interface for cross-chain yield farming. Target users include DeFi investors, yield farmers, and crypto holders seeking passive income without manual chain management.

Target market value: Simplify cross-chain DeFi interactions and maximize yield opportunities for retail and institutional investors.

## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
1. User connects wallet and views dashboard showing current portfolio
2. User navigates to deposit page, selects source chain (e.g., Ethereum) and token (e.g., USDC)
3. User enters deposit amount and confirms transaction
4. Vault automatically transfers funds to optimal yield chain (e.g., Polygon) via ZetaChain
5. User can monitor fund allocation and yield generation on vault status page
6. For withdrawal, user selects destination chain and amount on withdraw page
7. Vault processes cross-chain withdrawal and delivers funds to chosen chain
8. All transactions are recorded in transaction history with cross-chain tracking
